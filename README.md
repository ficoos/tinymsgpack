# tinymsgpack
Tiny portable implementation of msgpack.

It's built to be statically integrated into existing projects that don't want to link to the official msgpack libs.

## TODO
* Still some work cleaning up and minimizing the code.
* Float support isn't complete
* Ext types support
* Zero allocation (hopefully).
* More tests
